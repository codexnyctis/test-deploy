  "overview": [
    "Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are the most precise celestial timekeepers, providing unparalleled tests of gravitational phenomena, including the direct detection of the stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB). Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) - arrays of precisely timed MSPs - are key tools for these studies.",
    "MSPSRπ2 is an extension of the original MSPSRπ program that ran from 2014-2018. While the original program astrometrically studied 18 MSP systems and achieved 15 significant parallaxes, this new campaign targets 44 additional PTA MSPs that currently lack VLBI constraints.",
    "By applying Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) techniques to these pulsars, we can measure their positions, proper motions, and parallaxes with unprecedented precision. These measurements will significantly enhance PTA sensitivity and accelerate the study of the gravitational wave background.",
    "The project follows a staged approach with a pilot program to establish the calibrator environment and determine reference positions, followed by a precision program for full astrometric measurements. When complete, MSPSRπ2 will nearly triple the number of MSPs with VLBI astrometric measurements."

  "technicalApproach": [
    "MSPSRπ2 employs a staged approach to efficiently allocate observing time. The program begins with a pilot phase to establish the calibrator environment, detect the candidates, and determine reference positions and preliminary proper motion with two sessions per target.",
    "For each target, one 1-hour in-beam calibrator search session is conducted to identify suitable calibration sources within 30 arcminutes of the target pulsar. Following this, two astrometry sessions are performed, with session durations adjusted based on the target's flux density: 4 hours for fainter sources (0.2-0.76 mJy), 2 hours for medium brightness sources (0.76-1.2 mJy), and 1 hour for brighter sources (>1.2 mJy).",
    "The astrometry sessions are arranged around parallax maxima, with the second session occurring approximately 1 year after the first to optimize proper motion determination while minimizing parallax effects. The VLBA with all 10 stations is used, with a minimum of 8 stations required for adequate sensitivity.",
    "The project utilizes the psrvlbireduce pipeline, developed and optimized during previous projects, for consistent and efficient data reduction. All data products and results will be made publicly available through the gDMCP platform to enable reproducibility of the astrometric measurements."

  "scientificImpact": [
    "MSPSRπ2 will have a profound impact on gravitational wave astronomy through pulsar timing arrays. The direct detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background by PTAs in 2023 opened a new window for studying the astrophysical history of the universe. MSPSRπ2 will enhance and accelerate these studies by providing independent, high-precision astrometric measurements for a substantially expanded set of PTA pulsars.",
    "Beyond gravitational wave detection, the project will contribute to multiple areas of astrophysics, including tests of relativistic gravity, studies of MSP formation and evolution, mapping of the Galactic gravitational potential, and improved models of the interstellar medium. The comprehensive dataset will serve as a valuable resource for the broader astronomical community for years to come."
