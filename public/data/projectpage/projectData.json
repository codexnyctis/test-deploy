    "heroDescription": "Our multi-phase program (PSRπ, MSPSRπ, MSPSRπ2) uses Very Long Baseline Interferometry to measure millisecond pulsar positions throughout the Galaxy. The VLBA achieves parallax and proper motion accuracies of ~40 microarcseconds and ~40 microarcseconds/year for pulsars as faint as 1 mJy. These precise measurements help us enhance gravitational wave detection, test Einstein's theories, and map dark matter distribution, effectively creating a cosmic GPS network that reveals the invisible structure of spacetime.",
