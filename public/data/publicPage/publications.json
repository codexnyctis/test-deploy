        "abstract": "Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) astrometry of pulsars provides a straightforward and model-independent method to obtain distances via the detection of annual geometric parallax. The PSRπ program is a large VLBI pulsar astrometry program that has observed more than 60 pulsars with the Very Long Baseline Array. We summarize the astrometric results of the PSRπ program: parallax measurements (or upper limits) for each pulsar, and a three-dimensional map of the locations of the target pulsars in the Galaxy. The parallax measurements show that pulsar distances derived from the observed dispersion measure combined with Galactic electron density distribution models have an average error of 55% (80% when the predicted distance exceeds 6 kpc). The PSRπ observations also provided high-precision proper motions, enabling the accurate determination of pulsar velocities.",

This represents one of the largest samples of these distances measured with consistent methodology and including pulsars from many regions of the Galaxy.

Here, we present the astrometric results for 18 MSPs of the \"MSPSRπ\" project focusing exclusively on astrometry of MSPs, which includes the re-analysis of 3 previously published sources. On top of a standardized data reduction protocol, more complex strategies (i.e., normal and inverse-referenced 1D interpolation) were employed where possible to further improve astrometric precision. We derived astrometric parameters using sterne, a new Bayesian astrometry inference package that allows the incorporation of prior information based on pulsar timing where applicable. We measured significant parallax-based distances for 15 MSPs, including 0.81±0.02 kpc for PSR J1518+4904 — the most significant model-independent distance ever measured for a double neutron star system.",

The orbital decay of the system, characterized by the time derivative of the orbital period, can be predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity. A comparison between the observed and the predicted orbital decay requires precise knowledge of the system's distance, which we measured using the Very Long Baseline Array with very long baseline interferometry astrometry, yielding a distance of 0.94±0.07 kpc. The new, precise distance allows us to predict the orbital decay rate with significantly improved precision, enhancing the test of Einstein's theory of general relativity by a factor of 10.",

The observed orbital decay rate comes primarily from extrinsic effects, namely the Shklovskii effect (transverse motion) and the Galactic differential potential, which must be subtracted from the observed values in order to test intrinsic orbital decay due to dipole gravitational radiation—a phenomenon forbidden in general relativity. Using recent VLBI astrometry of PSR J1012+5307, obtained as part of the MSPSRπ program, we precisely measured the system's distance at 0.86±0.03 kpc. The distance significantly improves constraints on the orbital decay components, which leads to tighter constraints on alternative theories of gravity.",
